# Features

## Codeblocks

Codeblocks will automatically have code highlighting, but if you want to have a code preview as well you can add -preview to the markdown codeblock code.

The preview element gives you the ability to see the responsivness of what ever is inside. It has a mobile and desktop preset giving you the ability to easily see how items look in common screen sizes.

```js
` ``html-preview
  <div>Sample</div>

```
